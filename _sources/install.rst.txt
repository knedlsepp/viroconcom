Currently the easiest way to install viroconcom is to directly install from github::

    pip install https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/viroconcom/archive/master.zip

Alternatively one can manually download the package from https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/viroconcom/, navigate in to the downloaded folder and then issue the installation with::

    pip install .

    describe how to install from pypi once viroconcom is hosted there
